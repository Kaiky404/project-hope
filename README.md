# Project Hope

This was my **first project**, made in 2023, where I learned and practiced a lot of **HTML** and **CSS**.  
The JavaScript in this project was taken from ChatGPT—not proud of this, but I needed fast results at the time.

## What’s inside?

- Basic HTML structure  
- CSS styling to make the site look nice  
- Simple JavaScript features

## Why is this project important?

It marks the start of my journey discovering what I wanted to do, so it helped me understand fundamental front-end concepts. Every line of code represents learning and growth.

## Next steps

- Build new, more complex projects
